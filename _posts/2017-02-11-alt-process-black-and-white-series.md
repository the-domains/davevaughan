# Alien Emulsion

### portrait of an abduction

She told me she'd seen Big Foot. I wanted to believe her. Who wouldn't? Especially with that face, looking that way at my sorry puss. She was lovely beyond all others. Otherworldly almost. Then she explained how she was abducted by aliens ...

_Alien Emulsion (AE)_ is about things that go _squish, bloop_ and, yes, _bump_ in the night. Much like myself, in the musty orange-hued darkroom where I created these images, amidst caustic serums and silver-gelatin goo.

It sounds senseless and bizarre and it is. To ruin otherwise unscathed film. To purposely over and under mix solutions; to agitate and mishandle every vat of chemistry in an otherwise controlled lab, is scary.

More than just a new process_, AE _is also a pictorial diary. It's a metaphorical picture of an abduction ... by _aliens_. Not the illegal sort south of some border near _anywhere_, but the spacey types north of Venus, Alpha Centauri and beyond.

The technique is one I discovered one day (_or was it night? I can never tell in that swampy, blackened chamber_) while making prints for an exhibition called _Black, White & Blues -- _a series of open air concert photographs featuring legendary Blues musicians.

### "It felt as right as eggs and bacon or milk and cookies.

### It was _my_ peanut butter cup."

I wanted the images to dance out of the frame much like they did in the camera when the photographs were taken. Not simply frozen on the print, but springing forth, vibrant with ever tapping toes. So, I broke convention, dismissed the manufacturer's recommended times and temperatures and began to improvise on the traditional techniques I'd learned in school. Much like a musician might -- using the same three chords everyone learns to play yet mixing them up in a unique way -- I _jammed_ with my film.

Soon, I was sandwiching several negatives together, scratching their surfaces and weaving hair and leaves and other organic materials into the glassy view of the enlarger. The resulting concert photos felt LOUD and I could almost hear the music with my eyes. It felt as right as eggs and bacon or milk and cookies. It was _my_ peanut butter cup.

The photographs were no longer just two-dimensional, but they weren't quite 3D either ... more like two-and-a-half. It was as if there was this other layer of awareness, hidden yet tangible, living in the shadows. Whatever I discovered, it was foreign, alien, to anything I'd ever read in a textbook or gleaned from my college professors.

Thus, Alien Emulsion was born. Once I'd completed the prints for the _BW&B's_ series, I spent a feverish weekend working on this newer series about alien abductions.The subject matter fit the process even better. I always loved the mystery surrounding all things paranormal or anything that defied conventional science. In turn, I fell for this new free-form way of playing outside the norm of such exacting darkroom procedures ... altering science for myself, while creating these little monsters.

Along with each image in the _Alien _series, I've included some word pictures [-- haikus --][0] which speak to the phenomenon of closely scrutinized encounters that persist in our world. It's hard, for those of us who've never experienced an otherworldly visit, to believe. But it's also no easy thing to dismiss the countless individuals who continue with such tales.

I want to believe. I know there are _things _lurking in the closed closet of our minds, behind our sense of reason. I'd like to simply point to each of these images and shout, _"See for yourself, it's right there!" _But that half-dimension is a tricky one. It almost looks whole at times, evident, but soon it retreats just before the eyes can adjust and _whoosh_, back into the shadow world it slithers.

_I dedicate this series to anyone who has encountered the unexplainable and yet lived to NOT tell of it. May these images suffice -- if even just a little -- to bring light to some of what sloshes around in our own personal darkness._
