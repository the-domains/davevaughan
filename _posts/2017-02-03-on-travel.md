# **TRAVEL**

Embracing other cultures, and documenting my experiences with camera and pen at the ready, keeps my soul light, and more receptive to growth. I don't seek sameness. I don't wish for home while away. What's the point of travel if you'd rather take only what you know, with you? I'm after the unknown; the outer banks; the last road on the right, by the sea.

![I don't mind packing T.P. and carrying my own water. The complexities which surface in less developed lands than my own, only make me more grateful when I return.
